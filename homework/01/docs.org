* Question One
  Below is a "smart" search tree for the game provided. \\

  #+END_CENTER

  The "smart" search tree was contstructed with the following assumption in
  mind: The game is over if the target is destroyed and the piece could not
  be caputered by the opponenent on the next turn (the following opponents move
  was shown to illustrate this). If a move destroyed the target, it is denoted 
  on the tree with a diamond rather than a circle. \\

  This tree is very condensed from the full search tree and even a full "smart"
  search. However, the tree does illustrate the edge cases and the reader can
  draw conclusions from those to see that any case inbetween will result in the
  same outcome. \\

  For instance, if the black King persues the white pawn, and the white King
  moves diagonally, to try and support the pawn, it does not make it in time
  (first branch). It also shows that if the white King directly persues the
  black Pawn, the black King can capture the white Pawn and still leave time for
  the black Pawn to advance and destroy the target before the white King can
  intercept. From this, we can easily infer the white King could advance along
  the diagonal, and still fall short of reaching the black Pawn before
  it destroys the target (even though the number of moves did not change).

  Black appears to have the advantage in this game. The only way white may win
  is if it's Pawn persues the target first and the black King does not persue
  the Pawn on the diagonal towards the target.

* Question Two
** Part A
   The general reachability formula for the Queen is as follows.
   
   \begin{equation}
   \begin{split}
   R_Q(x, y) = \; &(x = (x_1, x_2) \wedge (1 \leq x_1 \leq 8) 
   \wedge (1 \leq x_2 \leq 8)) \;\wedge \\
   &(y = (y_1, y_2) \wedge (1 \leq y_1 \leq 8) 
   \wedge (1 \leq y_2 \leq 8)) \;\wedge \\
   &(|y_1 - x_1| \leq 8 \wedge |y_2 - x_2| \leq 8) \\
   \end{split}
   \end{equation}

   x \in Z \times Z, y \in Z \times Z

** Part B
   The reachability formulas for the King in a three dimensional space is as
   follows:

   \begin{equation}
   \begin{split}
   R_K(x, y, z) = \; &(x = (x_1, x_2) \wedge (1 \leq x_1 \leq 8) 
                                      \wedge (1 \leq x_2 \leq 8)) \;\wedge \\
                     &(y = (y_1, y_2) \wedge (1 \leq y_1 \leq 8) 
                                      \wedge (1 \leq y_2 \leq 8)) \;\wedge \\
                     &(z = (z_1, z_2) \wedge (1 \leq z_1 \leq 8) 
                                      \wedge (1 \leq z_2 \leq 8)) \;\wedge \\
                  &(|y_1 - x_1 - z_1| \leq 1 \wedge |y_2 - x_2 - z_2| \leq 1)\\
   \end{split}
   \end{equation}

   The reachability formulas for the Knight in a three dimensional space is as
   follows:

   \begin{equation}
   \begin{split}
   R_K(x, y, z) = \; &(x = (x_1, x_2) \wedge (1 \leq x_1 \leq 8) 
                                      \wedge (1 \leq x_2 \leq 8)) \;\wedge \\
                     &(y = (y_1, y_2) \wedge (1 \leq y_1 \leq 8) 
                                      \wedge (1 \leq y_2 \leq 8)) \;\wedge \\
                     &(z = (z_1, z_2) \wedge (1 \leq z_1 \leq 8) 
                                      \wedge (1 \leq z_2 \leq 8)) \;\wedge \\
                  &(|y_1 - x_1 - z_1| = 1 \wedge |y_2 - x_2 - z_2| = 2)\;\vee \\
		  &(|y_1 - x_1 - z_1| = 2 \wedge |y_2 - x_2 - z_2| = 1)
   \end{split}
   \end{equation}

   Assuming the following both of the equations:

   \begin{equation}
   x \in Z \times Z, y \in Z \times Z, z \in Z \times Z
   \end{equation}
