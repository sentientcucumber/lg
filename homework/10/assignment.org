For this assignment, we consider a modified Reti End Game in three
dimensions. We will use three chess boards (shown on the next page) to
represent a flattened view for two dimensions in the game. From this, we will
generate a reasonable search tree. Most of the board stays the same as the
*3D/4A* problem, with the exception of the Black Bomber and it's target
location. For this problem, it is starting at location 117 and it's target
is 817.  \\
