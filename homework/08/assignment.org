#+CAPTION: Maintenance planning model
[[./img/Maintenance.png]]

Above is the maintenance planning model for the homework assignment. Red and
blue were used to signify different teams. Each vertex in a path signifies a
day in increasing order. That is, the first dot represents day one, the second
day two, and so forth. The number of resources at a given point are given in
parenthesis. \\

The top piece, p_1, can only be completed on the first three days as day four
does not have the minimum number of resources available. We then can then
schedule one of the remaining pieces on the second and third day. The final
piece (either p_2 or p_3 depending on the previous choice) can be scheduled for
the third and fourth days. \\

There are two paths for both p_2 and p_3 since their scheduled days (days two
and three or days three and four) can be switched. They cannot be scheduled for
the same days though, the paths are mutually exclusive.
